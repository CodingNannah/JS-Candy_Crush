This is a simple one player "Candy Crush" game, which I adapted from Kenny Yip's Tutorial.

Game Creation Notes:
The video for this tutorial was very blurry, which made it hard to see. So, I ended up committing and pushing more often when things were working well.

Kenny uses var. I use const or let.

I really love how Kenny makes boards in JS. I don't have to do all that HTML copying anymore!

Added candy4 & candy5 + points for score.

Future Additions: 
I like this adaptation that he shared. I would make it so: 5 or square4 create stripes that wipe out either entire rows or columns for additional points.
